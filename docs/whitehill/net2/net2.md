Your game will need to be published for the product to work.

### 3) Product Installation {#3}
Use the built in Roblox movement tools to position the inserted doors and readers.
You can change the Readers and Buttons used on each door by placing the readers and buttons you wish to use in the applicable folders via the roblox explorer, But remember to delete any unneeded ones!

To use the K50 Keypad & Card reader with DWProx Net2+ you are required to download it from axon using the dropdown on the Net2+ product card. You will then need to move it into the "Readers" folder.

:::warning

There are a number of reasons your doors may not be working correctly. These include:
- The doors colliding with parts (These may be invisible or unions with incorrect collisions)
- 'Join Surfaces' is enabled. This will weld your doors to any parts they collide with whilst you are installing them.
- Using 3rd party movement tools such as 'Building Tools by F3X' have been known to break our doors during installation.

:::

### 4) Product Configuration {#4}
Please be aware there are 2 main configuration files, One named 'Settings' allowing for configuration of the door such as modes and speeds, With the 'PaxtonSettings' script allowing for configuration of the access control system. Each device also includes its own configuration file allowing for device-specific configuration.
