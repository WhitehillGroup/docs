## Getting Started

:::info Heads up!

You'll need to be able to access [Axon](https://axon.whitehill.club) to download and install certain Whitehill products. This is indicated on the product card on the [ePortal](https://www.roblox.com/games/13188104119/Whitehill-ePortal).

:::

Get started by buying or taking a Whitehill product from our [ePortal](https://www.roblox.com/games/13188104119/Whitehill-ePortal).

Once done, you can move onto downloading your desired product from [Axon](https://axon.whitehill.club) unless the model is provided via the [ePortal](https://www.roblox.com/games/13188104119/Whitehill-ePortal).
If you own licences for AutoPro or KONE Turnstiles, they will not show up on Axon as they are not using Axon licencing.
