### RetailPOS Mainbanks FAQ

### How do I add more tools? {#add-tools}
To add a tool, you need to go onto the `MasterConfig` & generate an EAN number, this can be a randomised number. Make it a billion characters, or whatever you want; it doesn't matter as long as it is unique. Once you have created the unique number, make sure you've filled in the details with the new tool using the `MasterConfig`.

Create a `StringValue` in the tool's handle, name the `StringValue` EAN, and place your unique number into its value.

### Some of my POS tills are linked together, how do I fix? {#linked-together}
One common mistake is that people forget to change the unique till number. You need to do this by clicking on an individual POS, then click onto the JSM | POS Terminal model, then the Screen block, then Settings. You can also change if you want the till to be on, off, or boot upon server start.

If you don't do this, scanning an item might link to another till, or logging in, etc.

### I can't click login, it won't do anything. {#cannot-click-login}
Same as above, there's only a player whitelist integrated, so you'll have to disable the whitelist as a whole if it's for a group. Do not ungroup.
