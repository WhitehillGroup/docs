### 3) Setup
Enter your SystemConfig under the JSM | ATM V3 folder. After which, feel free to update the settings. Information about each setting is available in the configuration script.

### 4) Linking with SCO V3 (optional)
If you have SCO V3 and ATM V3, you have the option to link them together. To do so, enter the SystemConfig file under JSM | SelfCheckout V3. Under the currency option, you should find a setting called 'JSMATMLocation'. Change the 'nil' next it to your ATM V3 folder. An example of this would be:
`["JSMATMLocation"] = workspace["JSM | ATM V3"];`
