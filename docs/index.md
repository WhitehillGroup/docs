You can get started by jumping straight into product documentation using the tabs above, but we would recommend reading the following FAQs first.

### How can I get my products? {#claim-products}
We have implimented a more streamlined process for purchasing and downloading our products. Please visit [Axon](https://axon.whitehill.group) to get started.

### How can I buy a product with real-life currency? {#real-currency}
Please use our dashboard on [Axon](https://axon.whitehill.group).

### Do you provide product transfers? {#product-transfers}
We have introduced product transfers through our [ePortal](https://www.roblox.com/games/13188104119/Whitehill-ePortal). With this system, you have the ability to grant or revoke transferred licenses.

:::info

Please be aware that AutoPro, along with KONE Turnstiles, do NOT use the new Axon licensing system. As such, Licence transfers are not possible with these products.

### How can I become part of the support team? {#support-team}
We do not often hire new staff members as we may be able to handle the load of tickets or have a decent amount of people in our team. Please keep your eye out for applications that may be posted, but we hand select our members most of the time anyways.

### Why are my products becoming unanchored once rotated in-game? {#unanchored-products}
If you're using the F3X plugin in studio, it tends to have a habit of breaking the welds - so please don't use them when working with our products. If you're using the usual method on studio of rotating, ensure you have selected everything inside the group of the product so the welds aren't automatically deleted.

### Why does my product say I don't have HTTP on when I do? {#http-overload}
If you have too many products using HTTPService at once, it can overload and won't send requests on the game server. You will find that on studio your products will work, this is because those requests are made locally and not on a game server. This can be fixed by removing some products/scripts in your game that may use HTTP.

### Are there items provided with any of our retail products? {#items-with-products}
We may provide a few example items, however its up to you to create all the products for your game. Use the example products to see how items are configured and go from there.

### Why am I getting kicked with the message "DWPSS has detected you are using counterfeit products"? {#dwpss-error}
There are 2 reasons this may be happening:
- You are using a version of <b>DWProx Net2+, SCO v3 or Scan & Shop</b> that was released prior to 26/01/24. You should update your Net2, SCO v3 and Scan & Shop with the latest versions from [Axon](https://axon.whitehill.group) to resolve the issue. Please see [this message](https://discord.com/channels/616745092279173151/1169430086500491375/1200237894430892072) in our [Discord server](https://whitehill.group/discord) for more detailed update instructions.
- You have tampered with your product - if you have done this and triggered DWPSS, please open a support ticket.
